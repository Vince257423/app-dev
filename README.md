#### The Straw Hat Pirates
1. Monkey D. Luffy [*Straw Hat Luffy*] - Luffy made his debut as a young boy who acquires the properties of rubber after accidentally eating one of the Devil Fruits that belonged to "Red Hair" Shanks.
2. Roronoa Zoro [*Pirate Hunter Zoro*] - Zoro is a highly skilled swordsman and serves as the crew's combatant, though he possesses an extremely poor sense of direction which recurs as a running gag throughout the series.
3. Nami [*Cat Burglar Nami*] - In the series, Nami is the Straw Hat Pirates' navigator, who dreams of drawing a map of the entire world.
4. Usopp [*Sogeking*] - Usopp is recognizable for his long nose, a reference to the fact that he tends to lie a lot. He is a gifted inventor, painter, and sculptor.
5. Vinsmoke Sanji [*Black Leg Sanji*] - Sanji is the fifth member and the fourth to join Monkey D. Luffy’s pirate crew as cook after the battle against Don Krieg.
6. Tony Tony Chopper [*Cotton Candy Lover*] - The power of the Zoan-type Human-Human Fruit provides him with the ability to transform into a full-sized reindeer or a reindeer-human hybrid. A drug he calls "Rumble Ball" enables him to perform even more transformations for a short time.
7. Nico Robin [*Devil Child*] - In the series, Robin is introduced as an antagonist, but eventually becomes the seventh member of the Straw Hat Pirates crew.
8. Franky [*Cyborg Franky*] - He constructs the Thousand Sunny, a brigantine-rigged sloop-of-war, for the Straw Hat Pirates and joins the crew.
9. Brook [*Humming Brook*] -  Brook's goal is still to fulfill his late crew's promise, and to that end he joins the Straw Hat Pirates.
10. Jinbei [*Knight of the Sea*] - After cutting ties with Big Mom, he joins the Straw Hat Pirates as the crew's helmsman.
