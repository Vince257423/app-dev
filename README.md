#### The Straw Hat Pirates
1. Monkey D. Luffy ==Straw Hat== - Luffy made his debut as a young boy who acquires the properties of rubber after accidentally eating one of the Devil Fruits that belonged to "Red Hair" Shanks.
2. Roronoa Zoro *Pirate Hunter* - Zoro is a highly skilled swordsman and serves as the crew's combatant, though he possesses an extremely poor sense of direction which recurs as a running gag throughout the series.
3. Nami *Cat Burglar* - In the series, Nami is the Straw Hat Pirates' navigator, who dreams of drawing a map of the entire world.
